# Projectile example for Ray Tracer

This is a standalone rust project that uses the ray library for the "Putting it Together" section of chapter 1 of "The Ray Tracer Challenge".

It relies on the ray library being installed in `../ray`. Clone that library from https://github.com/djboardman/ray

The program is hardcoded with the values from the book in Chapter 1.
